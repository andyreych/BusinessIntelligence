# Final Project CTS3452
In this project, me and my team formed by Johana Danton and Decoda Williams decided to use Northwind as a database to create the following reports using business intelligence tools such as Visual Studio, and Microsoft SQL Server. 
# Reports for the final project.
* Sales by Year (1996-1997-1998)
* Times Sales Data for the year 1997. 
* Pie Charts by Product Category representing sales in percentages for the 1997 year. 
* Total Orders by Employee for the whole years(1996-1997-1998) 
*  A list of VIP Customers that have orders totalling over $20,0000.
# Important Notes. 
- Our Team decided to use the 1997 year as a parameter for our reports involving time of sales to identify trends for the upcoming year.
- Our goal was to create a list of our VIP customers using sum of orders greater than $20,000 and identify their country of origin to focus logistic efforts and marketing purposes.
- The pie chart's objective was to calculate in percentages the product categories that represent the majority of the sales to measure customer demand in different categories and use the data to make a data driven decision in regards to their inventory.
