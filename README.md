# Final Project CTS3452
In this project, my team formed by Johana Danton , Decoda Williams and myself Andy Rey decided to use Northwind Traders, a fictitious organization that manages orders, products, customers, suppliers, and many other aspects of a small business to acts a sample database to create the reports to solve business tasks using business intelligence tools such as Microsoft SQL Server, and Visual Studio. Furthermore, this project is classified in different data analysis phases such as: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. This phases have the goal to communicate our findings to the stakeholders of Northwind Traders in a concise manner and follow a clear path of our data analysis using the skills learned in our Business Intelligence Reporting Services Class (CTS3452).

# Ask phase
* Sales by Year (1996-1997-1998)
* Times Sales Data for the year 1997. 
* Pie Charts by Product Category representing sales in percentages for the 1997 year. 
* Total Orders by Employee for the whole years(1996-1997-1998) 
*  A list of VIP Customers that have orders totalling over $20,0000.
# Important Notes. 
- Our Team decided to use the 1997 year as a parameter for our reports involving time of sales to identify trends for the upcoming year.
- Our goal was to create a list of our VIP customers using sum of orders greater than $20,000 and identify their country of origin to focus logistic efforts and marketing purposes.
- The pie chart's objective was to calculate in percentages the product categories that represent the majority of the sales to measure customer demand in different categories and use the data to make a data driven decision in regards to their inventory.





# Prepare the reports. 
- We decided to create two tables for the report named "Sales by Year" in which we created one tabular report using Year as a parent group, followed by the category , and then the total sales by product. In addition, we created a matrix report using the sum of sales values for each year and added an indicator for each year to indicate whether the target sales was met.

As we can see the report uses Years as toolkits to help the user get details for each grouping level.
